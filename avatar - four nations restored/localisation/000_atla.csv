ATLA.27;ENGLISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATLA.31;Your host and guards arrive, looking to lock you away in chains for their own benefit.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATLA.32;It seems the Avatar has taken... poorly to your choice. Swiftly defeating your guards, [From.GetSheHe] leaves you wounded but alive.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLA.31;I refuse to be imprisoned.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLA.32;They'll pay for this.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.94;After years of trying, I still can't bend at all! I don't understand why I can't when everyone else can.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.95;Today, [From.GetFirstName] came and asked you when they will start bending like you. As time wears on, it's becoming increasingly apparent [From.GetSheHe] never will.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.95;Maybe you're a late bloomer.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbending.95;It's common that some never learn...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.96;My [GetFromRelation] says that I still might bend one day.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.96;Obviously [From.GetSheHe] is just trying to make me feel better.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.97;My [GetFromRelation] says that some people never bend…;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.97;I wanted too though…;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.98;It appears [From.GetFirstName] has finally begun to Airbend, eager to make a mess of things and to start learning how to play air ball.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.99;[From.GetFirstName] came to you today and created a gust of wind that almost swept you off your feet.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.98;[From.GetSheHe] will be very happy.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbending.98;[From.GetFirstName] is an Airbender.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.100;After spending weeks training with the Healers, I was able to use my Waterbending to heal others!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.100;I'm a healer now!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.101;[From.GetFirstName] has been spending a great deal of time with the Healers, and now, [From.GetSheHe] too has learned how mend wounds with Waterbending.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.101;I'm proud.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbending.101;[From.GetFirstName] has done well.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCbending.101;Healing's not a warrior's duty.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.102;One day, after being scolded, you feel so angry you could literally explode. Shouting in rage, you do.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.102;Wow! Look what I can do!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.103;You hear an explosion outside. Rushing out, you find [From.GetFirstName] lying wounded in a smouldering crater. After rushing to treat their injuries, you learn [From.GetFirstName] caused this catastrophe with some kind of bending.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.103;This ability is much too dangerous!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.104;You hear an explosion outside. Rushing out, you find [From.GetFirstName] creating these explosions with some kind of Firebending as [From.GetSheHe] happily blasting apart everything in sight.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.104;What an extraordinary ability! Please stop!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.105;I've risen early every morning, listened closely to my instructors and practised whenever allowed. Bending comes naturally to me and I'm already more advanced than some adults.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.105;They'll be so proud of me!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.106;[From.GetFirstName] recently showed off their bending, impressing everyone. It's clear [From.GetSheHe] is extraordinarily talented and a born natural.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.106;[From.GetSheHeCap] makes me proud.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbending.106;[From.GetSheHeCap] did well, but there are more important things than bending.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.162;I'm nearing the end of my training, but I still think there's more out there for me to learn about Bending. Perhaps I could ask for help?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbendingA.162;I'm sure my parents can help!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbendingB.162;Maybe my parents could find someone to help me.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbendingC.162;Nah, I won't bother.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.163;Recently, [From.GetFirstName] came and asked me to complete [From.GetHerHis] training. [From.GetFirstName] is almost an adult and believes [From.GetSheHe] is ready to learn anything left we have to teach.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbendingA.163;I have nothing left to teach you, child.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbendingB.163;I'm sure there's a few more things you could learn.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbendingC.163;Well, perhaps there is one technique I could teach you.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbendingD.163;I'm too busy right now.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.164;[From.GetFirstName] has decided to teach me a special technique! I feel I'm so much better at Bending now because of it!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbending.164;Much better.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbending.165;Recently, [From.GetFirstName] came and told you that [From.GetSheHe] feels [From.GetSheHe] isn't as good a Bender as [From.GetSheHe] should be and asked if you'd be willing to pay for an instructor so [From.GetSheHe] can improve.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbendingA.165;I'll pay then.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbendingB.165;I'll do no such thing.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCATLA.2;Birth of the new Avatar;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATLA.2;It's me;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATLA.3;News is quickly spreading that Avatar [From.GetFirstName] has perished. Just as the old Avatar has left this world, in sixteen years it is expected a new Avatar will emerge, but such interregnums have often been fraught with trouble, chaos and war.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATLA.3;Such uncertain times;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATLA.4;After 16 years, the elders of my nation has declared me the new Avatar.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAATLA.4;I shall do my best.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCATLA.5;After sixteen years since the last Avatar perished, a successor has finally been identified as Avatar [From.GetFirstName]. Whether [From.GetSheHe] proves to be worthy of the title, time will tell, but for now what is certain is that the Avatar will set out to master the four elements once more.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLEATLA.3;Death of Avatar [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCduel_in.1;[From.GetFirstName] has exposed [From.GetHerselfHimself] on the battlefield and it is as if [From.GetSheHe] is brought to me on a silver platter. The moment is most oppertune!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_ent.1;Fire is power! Strength is all I need to persevere!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBduel_ent.1;The wind is freedom. I shall decide what happens in this battle.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCduel_ent.1;The waters are ever-changing under the eternal Moon. ;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDduel_ent.1;The very earth under my feet shall obey me. ;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTFduel_ent.1;I shall draw my weapon and my enemy will know my strength!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEduel_ent.1;A wise fighter knows when it is brave to enter a battle and when it is foolish - today is the latter.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAduel.1;"[From.GetFirstName]'s strong will and determination allows [From.GetHerHim] to quickly overpower me with a flurry of flames. I try my best to think of a way to counter my opponent but I must not ponder; it is now or never!";;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBduel.1;After masterfully evading several attacks, [From.GetFirstName] has stopped avoiding me and is now facing me! A single soaring wind blast is heading my way. I must now be decisive: what is my next action?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCduel.1;Spikes of ice and liquid surges home in on me from [From.GetFirstName], whose determination is not easily dissolved. The clear water is elegantly flowing around [From.GetFirstName] and [From.GetSheHe] is preparing for an attack. Now is the chance!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCFduel.1;Though not a bender, my opponent [From.GetFirstName] should not be underestimated. After a short but intense dance, [From.GetSheHe] allows me to respond in kind.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDduel.1;My opponent [From.GetFirstName] makes the ground beneath me roar like a mighty lion elephant and shards of rock rise to do [From.GetHerHis] bidding. [From.GetFirstName] makes a move. This presents an opening to me and I must decide quickly.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAduel.1;Hit the most vital organs;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBduel.1;Strike the torso region;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCduel.1;Strike the limbs;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDduel.1;Flee;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEduel.1;I must maintain balance and choose which element I shall use.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCAduel.2;I look in amazement as the battle has caused more damage to the once-beautiful vista than it has to me. My opponent's relentless use of force has made [From.GetHerHim] forget to maintain [From.GetHerHis] defenses. You now have an opening in which to act!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBduel.2;[From.GetFirstName] is an apt opponent and [From.GetSheHe] uses sudden stealthy strikes and quickly evades any of the attacks I throw at [From.GetHerHim], as befits an airbender. Suddenly however, my opponent makes a poor judgement call and I have an opening to respond!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCduel.2;The earth has been dificult to stand on, both from [From.GetFirstName]'s attacks and attempts to throw me off balance. As [From.GetFirstName] prepares another attack I see an opening!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDduel.2;My clothes are soaked and I'm freezing up. The floor is slippery, both from the muddied earth and the random bits of ice lying around. [From.GetFirstName]'s attacks continue. As [From.GetSheHe]  takes a fraction too long drawing water from [From.GetHerHis] waterpack I have a chance!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCduel.2;[From.GetFirstName] has closed in on me and metal is now clashing a mere arm's length from my face. My opponent is not to be called an unskilled fighter, sustaining my onslaught for so long. It can't last, however, as you manage to sense an opportune moment at which to act!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCduel.100;Something;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel.100;Something;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAduel_out.1;The heat is too strong and [From.GetFirstName] formidle attacks has pushed me back. As my defenses were down [From.GetSheHe] strikes a last time and the lights fade.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBduel_out.1;The wind are strong and [From.GetFirstName] has thrown me up and down against the ground. As I land a last time I feel a blinding pain at the back of my head.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCduel_out.1;[From.GetFirstName] has finally got the advantage and my lack of attacks has leaved me open to attacks. A last attack from [From.GetFirstName] sends a large boulder against meÄ;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDduel_out.1;My clothes is soaked and a chill has finally reached my bones. [From.GetFirstName] sets [From.GetHerHis] final attack in and body is locked in frozen water. My arms can't move and everything is cold.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEduel_out.1;[From.GetFirstName] is clearly used to close combat and my attacks find no room and my defences is being pulled apart. [From.GetFirstName]'s clup finally meets my head and I fall back.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.1;This is the endÉ;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAduel_out.2;A long battle has raged between us. An attack has been blocked by a defence and my energy is soon ended. [From.GetFirstName] sees my wavering concentration and strikes me to the ground.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBduel_out.2;Everyone of my attacks agains [From.GetFirstName] has been avoided and several of [From.GetHerHis] attacks has hit me. Suddenly I feel my feet being sweeped off the ground. The world spin once or twice and I suddenly hit the ground.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCduel_out.2;Hindering and launching my own attacks has been exhausting but [From.GetFirstName] is unstoppable. The ground has been shaken under me and suddenly a rock at the size of my head is coming towards me. I get thrown back and land on my back.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDduel_out.2;A fast series of water and ice spears has been thrown against me and most I've avoided. As I lauch my own attack [From.GetFirstName] push me down with a large wave from the exess of water the battle has left behind.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEduel_out.2;[From.GetFirstName] relentlessly attacks me and I can barely manage a defence. Even though I try my best too late I notice a quick punch to my face and I fall back.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.2;[From.GetFirstName] now has meÉ;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCAduel_out.3;A quick array of small burst of fires against me suddenly stop and I see [From.GetFirstName] flee from the fight.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCBduel_out.3;After having avoided my attacks and hindered [From.GetHerHis] attacks I notice [From.GetFirstName] vanish in a cloud of dust.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCCduel_out.3;It seems my attacks has been successful. [From.GetFirstName] has dropped [From.GetHerHis] attacks and is now fleeing the battle!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCDduel_out.3;Even after the attacks of [From.GetFirstName] suddenly [From.GetFirstName] has turned [From.GetHerHis] back to me and is running away!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCEduel_out.3;My superiority has finally resulted in [From.GetFirstName] turning [From.GetHerHis] back to me and runs away!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.3;Fear me!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCduel_out.4;[From.GetFirstName] has finally put me on my bag and the fury is burning in [From.GetHerHis] eyes and I have a choice!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.4;I'm begging you!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCduel_out.5;[From.GetFirstName] is laying on the floor is begging for [From.GetHerHis] life. What should I do?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.5;I accept and you can go!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBduel_out.5;I spare you, but you wil be my prisoner;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCduel_out.5;I decline and this ends here!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCduel_out.100;[From.GetFirstName] is before me lifeles. A terrible ending to the battle.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.100;I should never have happened like thisÉ;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCduel_out.101;[From.GetFirstName] has been incapicated and now I can put [From.GetHerHim] in my custody!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAduel_out.101;This should end this!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPduel_ent.1;You charge ahead!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPduel_out.4;You beg for mercy and to let you go;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCbending.9;My friends say that our ancestors have been firebenders for hundreds of years, but where did it come from?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.9;I should ask someone!;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPbending.9;You will ask the appropriate adult;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.10;[From.GetFirstName] has been to curious about firebending revently. Today [From.GetSheHe] asked me if I know its origns.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.10;Firebending originates from our ancestors eating all their vegetables.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.10;Let me tell you about the dragons!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCbending.10;It was the sun? Or was it the turtleducks?;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.11;[From.GetFirstName] sat me down and told me all about dragons today.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.11;When I grow up I want to firebend just as good as the dragons can!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.12;[From.GetFirstName] told me that our ancestors became firebenders from eating their vegetables.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.12;I hate vegetables!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.13;When I asked [From.GetFirstName] about where firebending originates [From.GetSheHe]seemed very confused;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.13;It's a mystery after all!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.14;I've learned a lot since I discovered I'm a firebender, but it feels like there's still so much to discover. /n I should ask someone  about attending firebending school or maybe my very own private tutor?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.14;I really hope I'm good enough!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.15;[From.GetFirstName] thinks it's about time [From.GetSheHe] attends a firebending academy to expand [From.GetHerHis] firebending skills.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.15;I'm all the education [From.GetSheHe] need!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.15;What a great idea!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.16;[From.GetFirstName] told me I can't attend the local firebending academy. I begged to [From.GetHerHim] over and over but nothing changed [From.GetHerHis] mind at all.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.16;[From.GetSheHe] is just jealous of my talent.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.17;[From.GetFirstName] says I can start school next week. I can't wait to learn more about firebending!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.17;I hope to make a lot of friends!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.17;I hope to make a lot of friends!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCbending.17;I hope to make a lot of friends!;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTEbending.17;I hope to make a lot of friends!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.18;The streets at [Root.Location.GetName] are buzzing with people and shopkeepers. Some street hustlers have attracted a crowd. They have incorporated fireferrets in their acrobatic show. One of the fire ferrets look scared with a collar on.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.18;I shall free the fire ferret!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.18;Not worth the risk;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.19;As I walked in [Root.Capital.GetName] today, I saw the cutest little fire ferret in the pet shop window.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.19;I just have to have it!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.19;I do not have any money on me though;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.1;My guardian is a skilled bender while my own skills can't compare. Even though I train everyday, maybe I could need some help?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.1;Maybe I should ask my guardian for help?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.1;No!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.2;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] is training everyday with me, but I still got some techniques to learn [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.2;I will learn you my techniques;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.2;It should come naturally;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.3;Even though I asked [From.GetFirstName] about [From.GetHerHis] techniques [From.GetSheHe] refused. Apparantly I'm supposed to advance on my ownÉ;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.3;That's disapointingÉ;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.3;Then I will learn it by myself!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.4;Lately [From.GetFirstName] has devoted more and more time to teach me [From.GetHerHis] own techniques and I'm sure I'll improve soon enough!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.4;The hard work begins now!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.5;My ward is training hard and is striving to achive my level of skill. Maybe I should give a helping hand?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.5;Yes, I should help!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.5;Maybe it's better not toÉ;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.6;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has noticed my hard work to reach [From.GetHerHis] level of technique and now offered a helping hand with achiving that goal.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.6;I will learn your techniques;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.6;Why bother?;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.7;My technique is near flawless and control over my element is increasing. Even though I've improved, it's clear my guardian is still better.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.7;Maybe I could learn this special technique you have?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.7;It seems like too much workÉ;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.8;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has showed increased interest in my specialized technique and now wants to learn it. It's a difficult technique and maybe too difficult for [From.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.8;It's too dangerous!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.8;I will show [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.9;My [GetFromRelation] is a brilliant bender, but unfurtunately [From.GetSheHe] deemed it too dangerous for meÉ;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.9;How sad..;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.10;My [GetFromRelation] is a brilliant bender and [From.GetSheHe] deemed me ready to try one of the most advanced techniques [From.GetSheHe] knows.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.10;Yay!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.11;I'm beyond dispute a skilled bender and my understanding of my element is only growing day by day. Today I worked on a new advanced technique I came up with myself and it seems like it is working beyond belief!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.11;This is only the beginning!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.12;A very good friend of mine have developed a very advanced technique and is boasting of the feat.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.12;I should ask for help with achieving the same thing!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.12;It's exaggerated!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.13;After many setbacks and bruises I finally have something to show for it. My bending technique is smoother and control of my element stronger.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.13;I've improved!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.14;I've suffered many bruises and setbacks in pursuit of improving my bending. Despite of this I've got nothing to show for it. ;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.14;All that workÉ;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.101;My friend is an excellent bender and is one of the few I know, who has specialized and developed a certain brand of bending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.101;I will ask for help with my technique!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.101;I can make it on my own!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.102;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has long admired my bending ability and has finally asked for my help.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.102;I will help for free!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.102;Perhaps a small compensation for the danger?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCtraining.102;Not my concern;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.103;I asked [From.GetFirstName] for help with learning such an advanced move and [From.GetSheHe] agreed to help me.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.103;Let the lesson begin;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.104;I asked [From.GetFirstName] for help with learning such an advanced move and [From.GetSheHe] agreed to help me for a price.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.104;I will accept.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.104;That is too expensive!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.105;I reached out to [From.GetFirstName] for help with advancing my bending but I was flat out refused. Maybe it is time to rethink this friendship?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.105;Maybe he isn't my friend.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.105;This shouldn't come between us!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.106;Even though I'm no longer young, my knowledge and power has been growing. Maybe I should focus my energy on a special technique?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.106;I've learned a new technique;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBtraining.106;I already know enough;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCtraining.107;As the seasons go by and my lifetime comes closer to an end, the new generation should take over. My strenth has been weakened and now it is time for the children to take over.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAtraining.107;I accept my own weaknesses.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.31;I was eating some delicious seaweed soup, when suddenly the liquid in my bowl splashed everywhere.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.31;Did I just waterbend?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.31;I'm so clumsy!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.32;Today [From.GetFirstName] told me [From.GetSheHe] waterbent [From.GetHerHis] soup.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.32;My [GetFromRelation] is a waterbender!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.32;A waterbender just like me!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCbending.32;You made a huge mess!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.33;[From.GetFirstName] scolded me and told me to clean up the mess I made.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.33;It was an accident!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.34;[From.GetFirstName] asked me to try bending some water again and it worked!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.34;[From.GetFirstName] says [From.GetSheHe] is proud of me. I can't wait to learn more!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBending.35;I'm excited to start bending but there's so much I don't know about it yet.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.35;I should ask someone!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.36;Today [From.GetFirstName] started asking me lots of questions about waterbending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.36;I'll tell you when you're olderÄ;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.36;Where do I start?;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.37;Today [From.GetFirstName] spent all day telling me about the finer points of waterbending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.37;I've learned so much!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.38;[From.GetFirstName] told me [From.GetSheHe] would answer my questions about bending when I'm older.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTABending.38;But I'm old now!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.39;The elders of [Root.Capital.GetName] says that our ancestors have been waterbenders for hundreds of years, but where did it come from?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.39;I should ask someone!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.40;[From.GetFirstName] has been so curious about waterbending recently. Today [From.GetSheHe] asked me if I know its origns.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.40;Waterbending is just an advanced form of tearbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.40;Let me tell you about the moon!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCbending.40;It was the ocean! Wait, that is not right!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.41;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] sat me down today and told me all about the moon.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.41;The moon is so pretty. I wish I could marry it.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.42;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] told me that waterbending is just an advanced form of tearbending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.42;I'm not a cry baby!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.43;When I asked [From.GetFirstName] about where waterbending came from [From.GetSheHe] seemed very confused.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.43;It's a mystery after all!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.44;I've learned a lot since I discovered I'm a waterbender, but it feels like there is still so much to discover. I should ask someone about attending a waterbending school.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.44;I reall hope I'm good enough.;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTAbending.45;I'm all the education [From.GetSheHe] needs!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.45;What a great idea!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.46;[From.GetFirstName] told me I can't attend the local waterbending school. I begget to [From.GetHerHim] over and over but nothing I said changed [From.GetHerHis] mind at all!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.46;[From.GetSheHe] is just jealous of my talent.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.47;[From.GetFirstName] says I can start school next week. I can't wait to learn more about waterbending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.47;I hope to make a lot of friends!;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCbending.48;Carrying my things around can be so much work at times. If I had a trusty buffaloyak, things sure would be easier.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.48;I'll just have to buy one.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.48;But I can't afford one.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.61;I was so mad at my parent for taking my toys from me. When I stomped my foot in anger the entire house shook!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.61;I must be an earthbender;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.61;Oh no, an earthquake!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.62;I was putting away [From.GetFirstName]'s toys when suddenly the house shook. [From.GetFirstName] says [From.GetSheHe] did it by stomping [From.GetHerHis] feet.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.62;My [GetFromRelation] is an earthbender;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.62;An earthbender just like me!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCbending.62;I'll have to explain to [From.GetFirstName] what an earthquake is.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.63;[From.GetFirstName] says I'm not really an earthbender after all.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.63;That's too badÄ;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCBending.64;[From.GetFirstName] asked me to try shaking the house again and it worked!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.64;[From.GetFirstName] says [From.GetSheHe] is proud of me. I can't wait to learn more!;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCbending.69;My friends tell me that our ancestors have been earthbenders since Oma and Shu, but who did they learn it from?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.69;I should ask someone!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.70;[From.GetFirstName] has been so curious about earthbending recently. Today [From.GetSheHe] asked me if I know who taught Oma and Shu.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.70;It was love that taught them.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBbending.70;It was the badgermoles of course!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCbending.70;The secret tunnet taught them... or was it a platypusbear?;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.71;[From.GetFirstName] sat me down and told me all about how the badgermoles taught Oma and Shu today.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.71;Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Though the mountain! Secret, secret, secret, secret, secret, tunnel! Yeah!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.72;[From.GetFirstName] told me that Oma and Shu learned earthbending through true love.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.72;Gross, I don't want cooties!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.73;When I asked [From.GetFirstName] about who taught Oma and Shu earthbending [From.GetSheHe] seemed very confused.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.73;It's a mystery after all.;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTBbending.78;Money is an object. I don't have any to spare.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.91;Today I sneezed and suddenly went flying high into the sky;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.91;I am an airbender!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.92;An airbending master has taken a lot of interest in my airbending skill;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAbending.92;He will teach me well.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCbending.93;Since I can remember I've dreamed of riding my own skybison with the earth beneath me and the sky above me. The day has finally come for me to get my own skybison. But how will I know which one to choose?;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESCspecial.1;As is customary for waterbender, training in the different techniques has been a part of your day from early childhood. Alas some techniques can't be learned, but can only be improved and perfected by years of training.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.1;Healing;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.1;I'm one of the lucky ones;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.2;Being part of the nomad culture of the sandbending tribes and an earthbender, means a large responsibility for the continuation of our culture. A large part of lives revolve around getting around the desert, but this can only be done by mastering sandbending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.2;Sandbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.2;And today I was officially declared a sandbender!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.4;Alas, my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been born blind. At first I hoped it would get better, but now I must accept the terrible fate that has befallen my beloved [From.GetSonDaughter].;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.4;A terrible tragedy strikes!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.4;I must do whatever I can to protect my [From.GetSonDaughter];;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.5;I might be blind, but luckily my other senses has been hightened significantly as a result. Since I was born blind, I've never known the color of the sky or the skylines of the cities. But being an earthbender has allowed me to sense the small vibrations in the ground. Since then I've tried my best to utilize this to my advantage.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.5;I learn seismicsense;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.5;It is almost as I can see!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.6;The Firelords was selected as the leaders of this mighty nation because of their superior innate bending potential. As Firelord, this is a heavy legacy to live up to, and on one point I have failed - lightningbending. After consulting the foremost spiritual sages, the power flowes through me as ever before.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.6;Ancient powers;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.6;I'm a lightningbender as my ancestors!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.7;As Firelord and a lightningbender I have decreed that every firebending academy in my nation is obligated to arrange courses in lightningbending. Hopefully this drastic step will strengten our benders and push our nation into a new era!;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.7;A drastic step;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.7;Hopefully I did the right thing…;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.8;The benevolent Firelord has forced the firebending academies to learn the students lightningbending. Despite a lot of injuries among the students and teachers, I'm one of the lucky ones, who have managed to learn it.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.8;Lightningbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.8;I'm one of the lucky ones;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.10;[From.From.GetFirstName] has been pacing and pushing me hard for some time. To master lightningbending isn't an easy task, but I have finally learned how to control ;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.10;Training lightningbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.10;I feel the energy surge through me!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.11;A calm and stable mind is essential for mastering lightningbending. During one of the sessions with [From.From.GetFirstName] I became overeager. The surge of energy that ran through my body couldn't be controlled and I didn't manage to release it proberly.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.11;Training lightningbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.11;I do not think I will be able to train for a while.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.12;To master lightningbending one has to master a complete stable and calm mind. Achieving this was easier said than done, and as a result nothing has come of my training.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.12;Training lightningbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.12;Hopefully I get to try another time.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.13;[From.From.GetFirstName] has appoached about mastering lightningbending. Mastering lightningbending has made [From.From.GetFirstName] one of the worlds best benders, but I'm aware of the dangers it carry.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.13;Training lightningbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.13;I will begin my training;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspecial.13;I dare not take the risk!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.14;The training I offered my [GetFromRelation] has carried great results and I'm now more respected;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.14;That is great to hear;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.15;Training my [GetFromRelation] has taken a terrible turn of events. In [From.GetHerHis] eagernes [From.GetSheHe] was hurt bad.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.15;What a terrible thing!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.16;Mastering lightningbending is a difficult task and unfornuately, now everyone is cut out to handle the energy. This turned out to be the case here, sadly.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.16;A waste of time…;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.17;Feeling the earth move with each vibration has given me an unique insight in how to control each part of the earth. As I have enhanced this technique I've come to a startling realization. Metal contains small parts of earth, which I can ben to my will.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.17;Metalbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.17;I can bend metal now!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.18;What exciting times we live in! An earthbender has revealed to the world, the ability to change the form of metal to their will. This could lead to new dicoveries.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.18;Soon whole cities will be made of metal!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.19;After some time trying to master metalbending from [From.From.GetFirstName] I have finally managed to bend this resiliant metal to my will;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.19;Finally!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.20;Despite [From.From.GetFirstName]'s warnings, I decided to try to stop a metalpole being thrown against me. Unfurtunately I didn't manage to catch it proberly.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.19;Training metalbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.20;Training metalbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.20;Guess I aren't as good a catch as I thought..;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.21;Sometimes training isn't enough. Learning to control small particles of earth within a purified metal is like cathing a specific butterfly with chopsticks. It is no shame I failed at this.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.21;Training metalbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.21;It is difficult.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.22;[From.From.GetFirstName] has offered to teach me a higly advanced technique. Bending the earth within metal. An almost impossible feat, which  does contain some risisk during the hard training.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.22;Training metalbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.22;I will take on the challenge;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspecial.22;I would rather not risk it.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.23;After training [From.GetRelation] [From.GetFirstName], [From.GetSheHe] has learned metalbending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.23;During training, we spend much time in each others company.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.24;Training metalbending can sometimes be dangerous. Sometimes the reward is equal to the risk. This time my student has been injured.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.24;Perhaps it wasn't worth it…;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.25;Metalbending has never been an easy discipline to learn. None the less I deemed [From.GetFirstName] to be capable of learning it.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.25;This time I was wrong…;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.26;Being captured and held against my will has allowed me a lot of free time. As a waterbender, the guards are naturally carefull of giving my acces to water. As the time has gone, I have noticed an increasing power during the full moon and it is like I can feel the life around me.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.26;I will start to use my powers on small rodents.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspecial.26;I'm a good person. I can't do that.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.27;The last two weeks I have tried to control the water in small rodents. Some of them unfurtunately died as a result, but I finally have some control of it.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.27;I can't stop now. Seeing the small creatures in pan will help me.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspecial.27;Better to stop now. This is too cruel.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.28;After more time, I have finally managed to have full control of the rodents. The next full moon could very well be my chance to escape.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.28;I will try to escape at the next full moon!;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspecial.28;Controlling another human being is just too cruel.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTCspecial.28;I'm free, so no need to escape!;;;;;;;;;
TOOLTIPAspecial.28;You will try to escape soon.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.29;As soons as the night dawns, I fake cramps in my left leg. As expected, two guards come by to see what the fuss is about. As sudden as my cries stopped, the guards' cries were heard down the hall, as I slammed them together, before using one of them to hand over the key. I turn the key and the door springs open. As I rush through the prison I have to make a decision.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.29;I will search for the prison warden;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspecial.29;I shall search for a safe escape route.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.30;I'm killed;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.30;Nothing;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.31;I came upon the prison ward and after a short fight I managed to incapicate [From.GetHerHim]. I used [From.GetHerHim] as a shield as I escaped, but an unfurtunate arrow from my captors rendered [From.GetHerHim] useless.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.31;At least I escaped.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.32;Apparantly [From.GetFirstName] tried to escape my prison. This can't go unpunished, with further deprivation of water.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.32;Let me see you escape this!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.33;A strange report from my prison has reached me. Apparantly a prisoner escaped. Not through bending, but by controlling people with a waive of a hand.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.33;Surely they are covering their own mistakes.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.29;Bloodbender tries to escape;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.35;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] was killed during [From.From.GetFirstName]'s escape from my prison. Apparantly [From.From.GetFirstName] could control the guards.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.35;Will [From.From.GetSheHe] come for me now?;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.36;Seeing animals and humans in pain has brought me much pleasure. Recently I have started to push my control over small animals further than ever before, by using my waterbending. Slowly it dawned upon me, that these creatures consist of water too. After going through a lot of animals, I have finally perfected my bloodbending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.36;Cruel bloodbender;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.36;Perhaps I can control humans as well?;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspecial.36;Total control is boring.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.37;Bloodbender revealed;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.37;Recently there has been reports of [From.GetFirstName], a powerful bender, who has managed to control other people by controlling the water in people.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.37;That is worringly.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.38;Training bloodbending is difficult, because of the very nature of the technique. Despite my initial rejections of the technique, I have finally mastered it.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.38;Training bloodbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.38;I'm a bloodbender now.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPAspecial.29;You find the wardens office!;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPBspecial.29;In the search for the wardens office, reinforcements arrive and subdues you.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPCspecial.29;You escape and get back home.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTOOLTIPDspecial.29;Despite searching for several hours, I've found no exit and has been subdued by the guards.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.39;To master bloodbending, one have to have felt it on your own body, to know how it feels to control another person. During one of these sessions, my trainer [From.From.GetFirstName] made a mistake and broke my leg.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.39;Training bloodbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.39;I don't dare bloodbend again.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.40;Controlling another human being is something that takes an enourmous amount of effort and control over the element. Sadly I haven't managed to achieve those things,;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.40;Training bloodbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.40;Perhaps it is for the better.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.41;[From.From.GetFirstName] has approached me and thinks of sharing one of the darkest secrets of waterbending with me. Learning bloodbending is hard and can even be dangerous.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.41;Training bloodbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.41;I'm willing to take the risks;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspecial.41;I'm not prepared to learn this dark secret;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.42;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has managed to master the art of controlling another living being against it's will.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.42;I'm so proud;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.43;During a training session, where I controlled [From.GetFirstName] I made a mistake and broke [From.GetHerHis] leg.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.43;[From.GetSheHeCap] probably won't walk again. ;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.44;Despite huge efforts from both sides, my protege hasn't managed to master bloodbending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.44;Not all has it in them.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.45;After careful consideration I have decided to give up my control over other living being.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.45;I already feel much better.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.46;After giving up my earthly tethers, I'm finally ready to fly among the birds and the skybisons.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.46;Flight;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTSpecial.46;I feel light as a feather.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.47;As a firebender I have a great control over the element. As time has progressed, my understanding of the element has become better. A simple solution to a simple problem. How to put as much power in a single strike as possible. I have finally managed to compress the firepower in a single shot, concentrated from my head.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.47;Combustionbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.47;It is a fearsome technique.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.48;Combining and forcing so much force through a single point carries a great risk. Fornutaly I have managed to control it very well and am now able to control it.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.48;Training combustionbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.48;I'm a combustionbender!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.49;Forcing a large amount of energy through a single point just above the eyes carries a great risk. An imbalance in my chi made an explosion which sent me back several meters.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.49;Training combustionbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.49;I won't be able to bend for some time!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.50;Despite my best efforts, I haven't been able to control my chi enough to channel the energy towards my head. Even though I didn't learn it, at least I avoided an explosion just in front of my face.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.50;Training combustionbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.50;Perhaps it is for the best.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.51;My [From.GetFromRelation] [From.From.GetFirstName] has decided I'm worthy of the challenge of learning to challenge my chi to the head and fire a powerful shot against my opponents.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.51;Training combustionbending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.51;I will take the risk of the training;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTBspecial.51;I would rather not risk it.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.52;As a result of hard work [From.GetFirstName] has managed to learn to fire a single shot of intense energy against [From.GetHerHis] enemies.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.52;I'm so proud;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.53;Combustionbending is a dangerous bending technique and unfurtunately my dear [From.GetFirstName] hurt [From.GetHerHis] head as a result of a single mistake.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.53;It's a dangerous world.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.54;Despite our best efforts, [From.GetFirstName] has not learned to master combustionbending.;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTAspecial.54;It's a difficult technique.;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.55;Moving the earth creates tensions in the surface. Tensions which could be utilized in combat if used right. Obviously ripping a tear in the earth's crust requires a lot of energy, but after a lot of training I have finally managed to control it.;;;;;;;;;
EVTTITLEspecial.55;Lavabending;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTspecial.55;I'm a lavabender now!;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESCspecial.56;Despite of the peaceful teachings of the airnomads, sometimes more violent measures must be taken to enforce the peace of the world. As an airbender I have managed to draw the air itself out of anyone who might prove a threat.;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTANOMAD.5;I wish him well in life.;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC10;I am surely with child.;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC11;[From.GetFirstName] is surely with my child.;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC15;Now that I am an adult, I may have to uphold our traditions and our nomadic way of life, but I am also now free to live it as I wish. Perhaps now is my chance to wander the world on my own.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.15;I will go!.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.15;No, I am needed here.;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC204A;While it is true that I have strayed from my old beliefs, the Council of Elders has now chosen to make the decision to expel me from their number for that very reason..;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC204B;It appears that [Root.GetFirstName] has strayed from beliefs, choosing the path of ignorance instead of our people's sacred traditions. For that reason, [Root.GetSheHe] is expelled from the Council of Elders, no longer one of us..;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.204;Leave them to their bickering.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.204;Perhaps one day [Root.GetSheHe] may regret such choices..;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESCA401;After coming of age, my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has come and stated [From.GetHerHis] desire to embrace our people's nomadic nature and journey abroad. While ultimately [From.GetSheHe] is set on going, you have the final say in the matter.  ;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESCB401;After coming of age, the young pupil [From.GetFirstName] has stated [From.GetHerHis] intention to leave the Temple and embrace our people's nomadic traditions by travelling abroad.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.401;I hope [From.GetSheHe] has safe travels.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.401;No, I forbid it, [From.GetSheHe] is needed here.;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESCA402;After coming of age, my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has decided to shun tradition and has not decided to depart the temple, instead choosing to stay and busy [From.GetHerselfHimself] in [From.GetHerHis] usual work.;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESCB402;After many weeks, it has become clear that young pupil, [From.GetFirstName] has decided not to follow tradition, choosing to remain at the temple instead of being a true nomad, busying [From.GetHerselfHimself] in work.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.402;I will not allow it. [From.GetFirstName] should go and live.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.402;Very well, such a journey isn't for everyone.;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC408;Recently, my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has written home, concerning [From.GetHerHis] travels. Apparently, [From.GetFirstName] has made a very close companion with a fellow traveller. From the sounds of it, it appears this [FromFrom.GetFirstName] is becoming very close to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.408;I'm happy [From.GetSheHe] has found companionship.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.408;I should tell [From.GetHerHim] that [From.GetHerHis] love is misplaced.;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESCA410;After a long journey, my [GetFromRelation] has finally returned home. For [From.GetHerHis] travels, [From.GetFirstName] is clearly a wiser soul, having experienced the wider world and it's joys.;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESCB410;After a long journey, [From.GetFirstName] has returned to the Temple from which [From.GetSheHe] was born. Clearly, [From.GetHerHis] travels have given [From.GetHerHim] insight into the wider world.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.410;I'm glad you have returned to us.;;;;;;;;;x
NOMADEVTDESC412;Many guests pass through every now and then, but a particularly interesting traveller seems to have caught the eyes of your courtiers, an Air Nomad by the name of [From.GetFullName].[From.GetSheHeCap] hails from the distant Air Temples, speaks of strange philosophy and wows many with [From.GetHerHis] Airbending abilities. Perhaps this traveller should be invited as a guest of your court?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADA.412;It would be interesting to meet one of these Nomads.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADB.412;Bah, I have no time for vagrants!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANOMADC.412;Sadly, I'm busy at this time.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.4;Ever since your coronation, you have been sleeping soundly. You've been the among the few to be Firelord and not descended from the Hong's who founded the Nation. You wonder if House [Root.GetDynName] will last just as long.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelord.4;I'm sure we will.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.5;Recently, your dreams have taken a turn for the worse. The nightmares now haunt you not only in sleep, but throughout the day. You cannot remember what troubles you, but you cannot help but feel something terrible is coming.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelord.5;Bah, just bad dreams.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.6;You wake up sweating, still in a state of terror. The memory of your dream is still fresh in your mind, a faceless creature looming over you...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordA.6;I'm not scared of some bad dreams...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordB.6;I must see a Sage at once!;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.7;As you find no answer to your questions, the nightmares drag on. Now, you realise the court has become terrified of you and your ever worsening condition. You can't hear them, but surely in the shadows, they whisper that you've gone mad.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelord.7;I'm not crazy! I'm not!;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.8;As the days drag on, you no longer even remember the nightmares upon waking, but your madness grows all the same. Apparently, rumours abound of Dark Spirits roaming the night now just beyond the Capitol. Rumours grow too that your rule is cursed.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordA.8;They can whisper all they want...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordB.8;Banish all the traitors!;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.9;Terror has spread throughout the Capitol as sightings of Dark Spirits grow in number. People whisper that they steal children in the night, and so far, the city guard have been powerless to stop them.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelord.9;What kind of evil creatures are these?;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.10;As the Dark Spirits continue to sow terror, people are fleeing the Capitol in droves into the countryside. Even the Ministers and the members of the Imperial Guard have begun to flee.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordA.10;Let the cowards run!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordB.10;Shut the gates! Nobody leaves me!;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.11;Word has come that some upstart child has claimed to be a long lost descendent of House Hong and rightful Firelord. As much as you've spent hours laughing, your courtiers continue to insist his supporters are growing in numbers.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelord.11;I'm still laughing, but go ahead and kill them.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.12;Recently, Firelord [From.GetFirstName] has been behaving extremely erratically. Some even say our ruler has even gone mad, whispering and babbling about spirits and traitors. Whatever it is, it may lead our nation to ruin unless this is stopped.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelord.12;This is concerning.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.13;Our Firelord has certainly gone mad and now news is spreading not only is the Capitol in chaos, but a young Lord of House Hong is leading a rebellion to reclaim the throne. We must choose whether our loyalties lie to our Firelord or to this upstart.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordA.13;Our loyalty is to the Firelord!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordB.13;We must help the Prince restore sanity!;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.14;The very next night, you meet with the Fire Sages in the Capitol Temple. They assure you they will look into any Spiritual disturbances that may be going on, but until then, they advise you to rest.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelord.14;I am grateful for their help.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.15;A Fire Sage has finally replied to your request for aid. Apparently, he believes that your unease may be caused by Spiritual disturbance in the Capitol. He requests your permission to accompany you into the Dragonbone Catacombs to find the source of this trouble.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordA.15;Into the Catacombs? I'm not going down there.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordB.15;Let us go then.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.16;Journeying into the Catacombs, tomb of all Firelords before you, the Sage comes across legends of the time before the Fire Nation. The tale speaks of Dark Spirits known as Kemurikage who sowed terror among the warlords, scattering their petty kingdoms to the winds.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelord.16;Fascinating.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.17;When the first Firelord united the islands, the Kemurikage retreated into the Spirit World as the conflict that spawned them ended. Now however, with the line of that Firelord ended, they have returned to restore balance.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordA.17;Great Spirits, how may I appease you?;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordB.17;I'm leaving, this is a fool's tale.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.18;The Sage begins a ritual to try and catch the attention of these Spirits, but pleads with you to take absolute caution when dealing with such entities. He warns you a wicked soul may incur their wraith.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordA.18;Summon them.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelordB.18;I should leave.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.19;The Spirits are angered by your presence, and they attack. They descend upon you, their lifeless eyes gazing into you. You wake up in the Royal Chambers. Nobody has heard of what happened, and you're left unsure if it even happened.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelord.19;It's all just a dream. Hahahaha…;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.20;The Spirits arrive, and after a moment studying you, seem contented, disappearing as fast as they appeared. The Sage is unsure if they are appeased, but believes that something will change. You leave the Catacombs behind, hoping something came of this.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelord.20;Hopefully this is over.;;;;;;;;;x
firelordDESC.21;After a month, you have no longer been having any troubling dreams as of late. There has been no more disturbances, and it appears this Spiritual crisis is over.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTfirelord.21;What a relief.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RIP_11053_WATERBENDING_HEALER;A traveller recently arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName]. It appears this wanderer is a Waterbending Healer, by the name of [recruited_physician_target.GetFirstName] and has been healing local residents. Perhaps [recruited_physician_target.GetSheHe] could stay as our Healer?;Un marchand de la route de soie est récemment arrivé à [Root.Capital.GetName].

EVTDESCATLA.104;Recently, [From.GetBestName], has talked repeatedly with me about [From.Religion.GetName]. It is clear that he wishes me to adapt a similar way of thinking, and admissibly, I feel I should.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLAA.104;Then maybe it is the right way of thinking.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLAB.104;No, I think I prefer my ways for now.;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCavatar.193;Recently, [From.GetBestName], has visited your home on [From.GetHerHis] journeys. Though they have stayed only a few short weeks, you can tell something is quickly growing between the two of you.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatarA.193;I think I'm in love;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatarB.193;No, it's not appropriate.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCavatar.194;For the past few weeks, [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been visiting your province, and now, [From.GetSheHe] and [From.GetBestName] has come before you and asked permission to marry. You were not aware there was something brewing between the two, but both seem quite certain of their love.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatarA.194;I will allow it.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatarB.194;I cannot allow it.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCavatar.197;Recently, you received a visitor, one [From.GetBestName]. It appears [From.GetSheHe] is looking for a new employer, and has come to ask permission to join your court.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatarA.197;Of course there is room for you.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatarB.197;There is no place for you here.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCavatar.198;It appears [FromFrom.GetBestName] has decided to leaving home, setting off to join [From.GetBestName]'s court.
EVTOPTCavatar.198;[From.GetBestName] will be missed.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCavatar.200;Word has come that Avatar [From.GetFirstName] is coming to our aid in our struggle, bringing allies to our defence!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatar.200;I dare hope this may be enough to save us.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCavatar.201;Our commanders are reporting that reinforcements are coming to the aid of our enemies, led by none other than Avatar [From.GetFirstName]. It appears the Avatar has rallied others to [From.GetHerHis] cause in [From.GetHerHis] efforts against us.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCavatar.201;[From.GetSheHeCap] cannot hope to halt our entire army...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCavatar.205;With the death of [From.GetFirstName], you know yet more sorrow. You also feel the burning desire for revenge, knowing your dear [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] was murdered by [FromFrom.GetBestName]. For this crime, there must be punishment.;;;;;;;;;x
