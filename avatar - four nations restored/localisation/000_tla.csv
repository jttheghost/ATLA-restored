ATLAILLOPT.3;Thank the Spirits!;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
ATLAILLDESC.8;You feel a sudden onset of weakness, like your body has been drained of all strength. Your coughing grows worse, as does your pain and fever. You have contracted the dreaded Takuan Cough.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTLA_AIR.403;Miraculous news has spread through the Temple. [From.GetTitledName], having been thought disappeared almost a century ago, has returned upon [From.GetHerHis] Sky-Bison, not a day older. [From.GetTitledName] is quick to tell tales of having flown into a storm, only to be caught beneath the waves, triggering the Avatar State and freezing [From.GetHerselfHimself] for all this time. Now, after all this time, the Avatar has returned home, with a pair of companions from the Water Tribe.\n\nStill however, the Avatar is disheartened by the passage of time. Everyone [From.GetSheHe] once knew at the temple is long gone. For that reason, the Avatar refuses to stay, insistent on pressing onward to the Northern Water Tribe to begin [From.GetHerHis] Waterbending training.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA_FIRE.403;A hurried messenger brings word from one of our outposts close to the ruins of the old Southern Air Temple.

EVTDESCTLA_OTHER.403;A hurried messenger brings word from one of our outposts close to the ruins of the old Southern Air Temple. This morning, a group watchmen claims to have seen a Flying Bison in the skies overhead. Strange, considering such creatures havent been seen here ever since the fall of the Air Temple. That, combined with sightings of a Fire Nation warships nearby, has your advisors suggest this may be some kind of prelude to a Firebender attack. You are interrupted however, when a bright beam of light suddenly appears on the horizon, in the direction of the Southern Air Temple itself.;FRENCH;GERMAN;;SPANISH;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETLA.405;The Avatar on Kyoshi Island;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.405;Early this morning, a group of Kyoshi Warriors brought three outsiders on the island to the village, finding them snooping around. These strange children don't strike you as Fire Nation spies, two obviously being from the Water Tribes further south and another dressed in peculiar, orange robes. When questioned by the Warriors, the orange-dressed [From.GetBoyGirl] claims to be the village's founder, Avatar Kyoshi herself! Despite the Warrior's doubt, the boy quickly proves [From.GetHerHis] claims, bending the air. It is so, that this child, who calls [From.GetHerselfHimself] [From.GetFirstName], is the long lost Avatar, returned at last!;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLAA.405;We wish you well on your journeys, Avatar.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLAB.405;We must welcome the Avatar with a feast!;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.406;As the governor of Kyoshi Island, any time you actually spend on the island tends to be uneventful and tiresome. Not so this morning as news reaches you that a native uprising has begun, spurred on no less than by a visit by three children, one who claims to be the Avatar [From.GetHerselfHimself]! It awes you that the natives actually believe this, rising up in mass under the banner of their idol, the long dead Avatar Kyoshi. Unless the Firelord sends assistance soon, you're not sure you can deal the sheer number of this rabble;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAA.406;Send the Messenger-Hawk immediately!;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.407;Rumours continue to spread regarding the Avatar's return. Some say that the Avatar has appeared on Kyoshi's Island in the southernmost region of the Earth Kingdom and has continued travelling northward.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLAA.407;That's Interesting if true...;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.408;Rumours continue to spread regarding the Avatar's return. Kyoshi Island has risen up in rebellion against its occupiers as word spreads the Avatar has been sighted on the island. Apparently, the Avatar continues northward, spreading the seeds of rebellion.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLAA.408;It'll take more than a single island to change things.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.410;It appears recently that the Avatar has swept through our province, yet another one scarred by the ongoing war. Though [From.GetSheHe] did not stay for long, apparently, this visit has inspired many to join the fight against the Fire Nation.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTATLAA.410;Good tidings indeed;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.411;It appears that this mythical Avatar has struck, [From.GetSheHe] and [From.GetHerHis] companions inciting rebellion in one of our work camps, causing the Earthbenders to rise up against us! If reinforcements are not sent, this uprising may quickly get out of hand;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLETLA.3;The North;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.3;It appears that shortly after the Avatar reached North Pole, and the stronghold of the Northern Water Tribe, a terrible cosmic terror occurred, with the moon in the night sky running red with blood. This  calamity was apparently caused by an ambitious Fire Nation commander known as Admiral Zhao, who unleashed thoughtless violence upon the great Spirit Tui.\n\nThe combined retribution of the Spirits and the Avatar quickly destroyed Zhao and his army, and somehow, the Avatar was successful in restoring Tui and ending the blood moon. Never the less, this event has left the world shaken and terrified of the Spirit's vengeance.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCTLA.4;Not long after the cataclysmic battle in the North, the Avatar has spotted again, this time in the city of Gaoling, far south in the Earth Kingdom. No doubt, the Avatar is now searching for an Earthbending Master, in order to master all four elements.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.5;Word has come that Fire Nation infiltrators have attacked Ba Sing Se with the help of treacherous Dai Li agents. For the first time, Ba Sing Se's walls have fallen, allowing the invading Firebenders to pour into the city. Panicked word is quickly spreading, rumour that the Earth King has disappeared and the Avatar has been slain. What is truly known however, is that the Earth Kingdom has fallen and the Fire Nation has captured Ba Sing Se.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.6;After being believed dead in the Fall of Ba Sing Se, the Avatar has again returned, this time alongside an attack by Water Tribe and Earth Kingdom forces upon the Fire Nation's capital city. While this attack may be quickly repulsed, it has signalled that the fight is far from over.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCTLA.7;It appears at the hight of his power, the Firelord has been defeated by the young Avatar. Stripped of his Firebending in a miraculous feat, the Firelord is powerless and thus, unfit for his own throne. Thus, his once banished son, an ally of the Avatar, Prince Zuko, has ascended the throne.\n\nThe newly crowned Firelord has proclaimed a new era of peace for the Fire Nation, abandoning the Imperialist rule of his predecessors and returning to the old ways. In turn, he has offered a generous peace to his enemies, the return of all conquered territory to the Earth Kingdom.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAA.4;Hopefully the Avatar will take action soon.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTTLAB.4;Hopefully, the Avatar will not last much longer.;A;A;;A;;;;;;;;;x
